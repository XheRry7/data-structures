/**** Stacks and Queues are linear data structures. Linear data structures allows 
us to traverse sequentially which means one by one. In which one data element can be directly reached */

/* Stacks : LIFO : One scenario in which we use stacks are browser history in which we go back and forth
. Another is when we write a text and want to undo that. UNDO and REDO use stack.It is basically something
 in which we place the last added thing in the memory so we can get that thing on the first.
 
Complexity:
Lookup: O(n)
pop(): O(1)
push: O(1)
peek: view the top most plate : O(1)
 
 */
/* Queue: FIFO: Queues are used in many scenarios like when we want to buy movie tickets. Also in restaurant app for checking tables. Most common example is a printer.
Complexities:
lookup: O(n)
enqueue(push): O(1)
dequeue(pop): It takes the first person to pop :  O(1)
peek: first person in the list : O(1)
